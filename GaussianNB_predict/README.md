# Gaussian Naive Bayes Disease Prediction Model

**Project Overview**  
This project utilizes a Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) model to analyze and predict breast cancer diagnoses. It helps classify tumors as benign or malignant based on patient cell nucleus features. The model is trained and tested using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset**.


## Background

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide, and early diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and recovery. This project aims to leverage machine learning to build a simple and efficient disease prediction model to assist in medical diagnosis.

### Dataset Information
- **Dataset Name**: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)
- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic))
- **Number of Features**: 30 numerical features
- **Number of Samples**: 569
- **Target Variable**: `Diagnosis` (Benign - B / Malignant - M)
